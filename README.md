# AIR-INDIA-DATASET-ANALYSIS-WITH-SQL-
Air India Dataset Analysis with SQL

Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing operational data from Air India using SQL. The objective is to uncover key metrics and trends within the aviation industry, such as passenger behavior, operational efficiency, and seasonality. By exploring aviation-specific terminologies like payload, available seat kilometers (ASK), and passenger kilometers performed (PKP), this analysis provides a deeper understanding of the aviation business model.

In addition to offering insights into airline operations, the project showcases my proficiency in SQL through a structured, hands-on approach. By solving real-world data challenges, I was able to derive actionable insights and hone my database analysis skills.

Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

Understand the Aviation Industry: Gain knowledge about key operational metrics and trends to better understand the aviation sector.

Enhance SQL Proficiency: Use SQL exclusively for data manipulation and analysis, improving both technical and practical skills.

Practice Business Problem-Solving: Address real-world challenges involving data filtering, aggregation, and operational insights generation.

This project served as an opportunity to combine theoretical knowledge with practical data analysis, making it a well-rounded learning experience.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed operational data for Air India, covering key performance indicators and metrics necessary for aviation analysis.

Dataset Overview:

Source: Kaggle

Description: The dataset includes information on flight routes, passenger statistics, and operational performance metrics.

Key Fields: Fiscal Year (FY), Month, Passengers Carried, Available Seat Kilometers (ASK), Passenger Kilometers Performed (PKP), Load Factor, and Flight Hours.

This dataset forms the foundation for analyzing operational trends and deriving actionable insights into Air India’s performance.

Approach

The analysis is structured into two distinct parts:

KPI Analysis: This phase involves calculating key performance indicators such as total passengers carried, passenger load factors, and other efficiency metrics.

Insight Generation: This phase focuses on identifying trends, uncovering seasonality patterns, and exploring operational performance through in-depth analysis.

This structured approach helped ensure clarity and focus throughout the project, enabling me to extract meaningful information from the dataset.

SQL Techniques Used

The project demonstrates a range of advanced SQL functionalities, including:

Joins: Combined data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view of the dataset.

Subqueries: Used for intermediate calculations and filtering, simplifying complex queries.

Window Functions: Calculated rankings, moving averages, and other patterns across partitions of data.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Broke down complex queries into reusable and modular steps, improving readability and efficiency.

Aggregations and Grouping: Derived key performance metrics and summarized data effectively.

Filtering and Conditional Logic: Applied precise filters and conditional operations to extract meaningful subsets of data.

These techniques highlight the versatility and power of SQL in handling large datasets and deriving insights.

Results

The analysis provided several actionable insights:

Key Insights

Operational Efficiency:

Top Departure Months: Identified the top three months with the highest departures over a decade, providing a clear picture of peak operational periods.

Passenger Trends and Flying Hours: Calculated the correlation between flying hours and the number of passengers carried, offering insights into resource utilization.

Passenger Trends:

Seasonal Load Factors: Analyzed seasonal patterns in passenger load factors, averaging monthly trends across all years to identify high-demand periods.

Quarterly Passenger Traffic: Highlighted peak and off-peak passenger traffic trends by quarter, enabling better resource allocation.

Comparative Metrics:

Annual Growth in ASK and PKP: Evaluated the annual growth in available seat kilometers (ASK) and its relationship with passenger kilometers performed (PKP), uncovering alignment between supply and demand.

ASK vs. PKP Trends: Identified years with the highest increases in ASK and PKP, indicating efficient operational scaling.

Challenges Faced

Understanding the Business Model: Familiarizing myself with aviation-specific terminologies and metrics required additional research, which helped contextualize the data better.

Query Optimization: Crafting efficient queries, especially for filtering and subqueries, was crucial to handle the dataset’s complexity and ensure accurate results.

These challenges provided valuable learning opportunities and practical problem-solving experience.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

SQL Scripts:

proinfo_kpiquerydomestic.sql: Contains SQL scripts for KPI calculations and operational metrics.

proinfo_insightsqlquery.sql: Contains SQL scripts for trends, seasonality, and deeper insights.

README: Detailed documentation of the project, including goals, approach, and results.

This structure ensures easy navigation and clarity for anyone accessing the repository.

Learning Outcomes

This project was an enriching experience, offering hands-on exposure to the following areas:

Aviation Industry Insights: Gained familiarity with industry-specific terminologies and operational metrics, enhancing domain knowledge.

Advanced SQL Techniques: Improved my SQL proficiency through the use of advanced functionalities like window functions, CTEs, and aggregations.

Practical Problem-Solving: Tackled challenges related to query optimization and data interpretation, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

Conclusion

By analyzing Air India’s operational data, this project successfully uncovered critical trends and insights while demonstrating the power and versatility of SQL in real-world data analysis. The structured approach, combined with advanced SQL techniques, highlights the potential for deriving actionable insights from complex datasets. This project not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the aviation sector.
