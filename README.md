# AIR-INDIA-DATASET-ANALYSIS-WITH-SQL-
Introduction
This project aims to analyze operational data from Air India using SQL. It explores key metrics and trends within the aviation industry, focusing on passenger behavior, operational efficiency, and seasonality. By diving deep into industry-specific terminologies like payload, available seat kilometers (ASK), and passenger kilometers performed (PKP), the project provided an excellent opportunity to understand the aviation business model better.

Additionally, this project highlights my SQL skills through a structured, hands-on approach, addressing real-world data challenges and deriving actionable insights.

Project Goals
Understand the Aviation Industry: Explore critical operational metrics and trends to gain deeper domain knowledge.
Enhance SQL Proficiency: Use SQL exclusively for all data manipulation and analysis to strengthen practical database skills.
Practice Business Problem-Solving: Address challenges related to data filtering, aggregation, and operational insight generation.
Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains operational data for Air India, including parameters like flight routes, passenger statistics, and performance metrics.
Key Fields: Fiscal Year (FY), Month, Passengers Carried, Available Seat Kilometers (ASK), Passenger Kilometers Performed (PKP), Load Factor, and Flight Hours.
Approach
The analysis is divided into two parts:

KPI Analysis: Calculation of key performance indicators like total passengers, passenger load factors, and efficiency metrics.
Insight Generation: Uncovering trends, seasonality, and patterns in operational performance.
SQL Techniques Used
The project demonstrates the use of advanced SQL functionalities, including:

Joins: For combining related data from multiple sources.
Subqueries: For intermediate calculations and filtering.
Window Functions: To rank, calculate moving averages, and find patterns over partitions of data.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): For breaking complex queries into modular and reusable steps.
Aggregations and Grouping: For KPI calculation and trend analysis.
Filtering and Conditional Logic: To extract meaningful subsets of data.
Results
Key Insights
Operational Efficiency:
Top three months with the highest departures identified over a decade.
Correlation between flying hours and passengers carried calculated.
Passenger Trends:
Seasonal patterns in passenger load factor (monthly averages across years).
Quarter-wise analysis of passenger traffic for peak and off-peak identification.
Comparative Metrics:
Annual growth in available seat kilometers (ASK) and its relationship with passenger kilometers performed (PKP).
Years with the highest increase in ASK and PKP identified.
Challenges Faced
Understanding the Business Model: Familiarizing with aviation-specific terminologies and metrics.
Query Optimization: Handling complex filters and subqueries to derive precise results.
Repository Structure
SQL Queries:
proinfo_kpiquerydomestic.sql: Contains SQL scripts for KPI calculations and operational metrics.
proinfo_insightsqlquery.sql: Contains SQL scripts for trends, seasonality, and deeper insights.
README: Detailed documentation of the project.
